<h1>Neural networks tutorial Tech With Tim</h1>

<p>This is my personal repo for keeping track of my progress on the neural networking tutorials. This tutorial explains the basics of neural networking with Tensorflow and the math behind. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lak7tiFDec5_ZMItiIIfmj" target="_blank">Link is here</a></p>
<p>In order to run these files you'll need the following libraries: Tensorflow, Numpy, Matplotlib. I used Python 3.7 for this project.</p>
