Don't believe the good reviews. JJ and his contractors are spamming. Otherwise, don't get why people are giving it good reviews. I also find it disrespectful towards good storytelling. The movie was also a sad insult to Carrie Fisher. I personally really disliked it and thought there was a lot of nonsense. Bad way to end it! How about next time you put a super slender girl in microskirt and boots in your movies, JJ?? That way I won't hate myself for paying $15 for a ticket.
